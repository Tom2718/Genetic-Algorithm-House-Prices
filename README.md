# Genetic Algorithm House Prices

This repo aims to use the [TPOT genetic algorithm library](https://rhiever.github.io/tpot/) 
to learn an optimal solution to the regression problem of house price prediction. 

This project is in relation to [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

Rerunning the learning process takes approximately 30 minutes on an average laptop.
